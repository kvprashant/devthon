          <h4>Coding Language</h4>
          <p>Applications can be built in any code that you please</p>
        </li>
	<li>
	  <h4>Fresh Code</h4>
	  <p>The main rule is that all code for your startup must be fresh. You can use APIs, previously built hardware, and/or open source algorithms, but all applications built must be new. Of course, you can work on the concept for your application before the competition starts, including paper and/or digital mockups of the user interface and database entity diagrams. However, no production assets of any kind can be created until the start of the official competition period (See Rule #3 for details). This includes “ready to slice” graphic design assets, application code, and user stories / test cases. When in doubt
	plan, don’t create.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <h4>24 Hours</h4>
	  <p>As a contestant, your team has exactly 8 hours to hack together your prototype/application. The competition starts at 1:00pm on Day 1 (typically Saturday) and ends at 1:00pm the next day (typically Sunday) . Hacking through the night is preferred if you wanna win the crown.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <h4>Submissions</h4>
	  <p>Each team will submit a hack by 2:00pm the second day. These are mandatory if you would like to present. We used to require video submissions, but no more.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <h4>Presentations</h4>
	  <p>Presentations will start at 2:30pm the second day. You will have 2 minutes to present to a panel of investor judges using anything you’d like. A/V support and an ELMO (phone/tablet projector) will be provided.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <h4>Judging</h4>
	  <p>We are looking for things that wow us — Things that have potential to be something amazing. Judges understand that you’ve built these things within 24 hours and aren’t looking for a finished product. They want to see a quality start, from a good team that is solving a problem. You don’t need a go to market strategy or industry analysis, but you should have a big picture idea of what this could be. Either that our something super funny. Your hack will be judged based on it’s Completeness / User Interface / Design / Originality / and in some cases – humor!</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <h4>Teams</h4>
	  <p>Should be comprised of between one and five individuals. No more than five people are allowed on a team. No robots, aliens, or superheroes. However, team members should feel free to dress as robots, aliens, and superheroes.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <h4>Ownership and Open Source</h4>
	  <p>Teams have full ownership of everything they build at our event and are free to do anything with it. We are simply organizing an event that gives you a platform to launch your ideas to the world.</p>
