		<p>Judges Big Data represents a fundamental shift in business decisionmaking. Organisations are accustomed to analysing internal data – sales, shipments, inventory. Now they are increasingly analysing external data too, gaining new insights into customers, markets, supply chains and operations: the perspective that Capgemini calls the “outside-in view”. We believe it is Big Data and the outside-in view that will generate 
		the biggest opportunities for differentiation over the next five to ten years.</p>

		<p>The topic of Big Data has been rising rapidly up our clients’ agenda, and Capgemini is already undertaking extensive work in this area all over the world. That is why we commissioned this survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit: we wanted to find out more about how organisations are using Big Data today, where and how it is making a difference, and how it will be used in the future.</p>

		<p>The results show that organisations have already seen clear evidence of the benefits Big Data can deliver. Survey participants estimate that, for processes where Big Data analytics has been applied, on average, they have seen a 26% improvement in performance over the past three years, and they expect it will improve by 41% over the next three.</p>

		<p>The survey also highlights special challenges for decisionmaking arising from Big Data; although 85% of respondents felt the issue was not so much volume as the need to analyse and act on Big Data in real-time. Familiar challenges relating to data quality, governance and consistency also remain relevant, with 56% of respondents citing organisational silos as their biggest problem in making better use of Big Data. For our respondents, data is now the fourth factor of production, as essential as land, labour and capital.</p>

		<p>It follows that tomorrow’s winners will be the organisations that succeed in exploiting Big Data, for example by applying advanced predictive analytic techniques in real time. I would like to thank the teams at the Economist Intelligence Unit and within Capgemini, along with all the survey respondents and interviewees. I believe this research will do much to increase understanding the business impact of Big Data and its value to decision-makers.</p>
